# YouTube scrapping using scraptube with flask 
As an ambitious data enthusiast, I have been working on my YouTube web scraping project using Scraptube, and I've also integrated it with Azure and MongoDB.

With the help of Azure, I was able to deploy my Scraptube-based web scraping project and host it on the cloud, which allowed me to access it remotely from anywhere in the world. I utilized Azure's scalable infrastructure to handle the high volume of data being scraped, and I could seamlessly scale up or down as per my project requirements.

I also leveraged MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, to store the extracted data from YouTube channels. With its flexible data model and easy-to-use query language, MongoDB allowed me to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. I was able to perform complex data queries and analysis on the data stored in MongoDB, which gave me valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the YouTube channels.

This project was a great opportunity for me to learn and apply new technologies to my data analysis work. I was able to integrate different tools and platforms to create a seamless data pipeline and gain valuable experience in data scraping, storage, and analysis.
